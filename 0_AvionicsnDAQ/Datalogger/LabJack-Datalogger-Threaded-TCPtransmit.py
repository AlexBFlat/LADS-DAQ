"""
This example uses Python's built-in threading module to help reach faster
streaming speeds than streamTest.py.

Note: Our Python interfaces throw exceptions when there are any issues with
device communications that need addressed. Many of our examples will
terminate immediately when an exception is thrown. The onus is on the API
user to address the cause of any exceptions thrown, and add exception
handling when appropriate. We create our own exception classes that are
derived from the built-in Python Exception class and can be caught as such.
For more information, see the implementation in our source code and the
Python standard documentation.
